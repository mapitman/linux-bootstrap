# Repository-specific ShellCheck configuration for linux-bootstrap
# The repo intentionally uses dynamic sourcing (curl | source) and some
# helper variables that appear unused to shellcheck, so exclude the
# noisy warnings below. Keep this minimal and revisit if new rules
# should be suppressed or tightened.
#
# - SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source. We intentionally source
#   remote snippets via `source <(curl ...)` in bootstrappers.
# - SC1091: Can't follow non-constant source during sourcing from files
#   (suppress because callers rely on runtime fetching).
# - SC2034: Variables that look unused but are intentionally provided
#   for external consumers or pattern matching.
